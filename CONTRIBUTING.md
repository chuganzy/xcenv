## Bug Reports

In short, since you are most likely a developer, provide a ticket that you _yourself_ would _like_ to receive.

First check if you are using the latest xcenv version before filing a ticket.
You can install the latest version with `$ brew upgrade xcenv`.

If questions in the error template are left unanswered, the issue will be closed
as a bad bug report.

If you are familiar with bash and bats, making a pull request with a failing test case
can speed up the resolution of the bug.

## Feature Requests

Please try to be precise about the proposed outcome of the feature and how it
would related to existing features.

## Pull Requests

We **love** pull requests. 

All contributions _will_ be licensed under the MIT license.

Code/comments should adhere to the following rules:

* Names should be descriptive and concise.
* All changes require test coverage to ensure it does not break during refactor
  work. (We will gladly help with writing unit tests)
* When writing comments, use properly constructed sentences, including
  punctuation.
* Remember that source code usually gets written once and read often: ensure
  the reader doesn't have to make guesses. Make sure that the purpose and inner
  logic are either obvious to a reasonably skilled professional, or add a
  comment that explains it.
* The message of the commit should be prefixed by the name of the file which is
  the main focus of the patch enclosed by square brackets (.e.g. `[Local]
  local can infer Xcode from xcodeproj file`).
