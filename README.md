## How It Works

### Choosing the Xcode Version

When you execute a shim, xcenv determines which Xcode version to use by reading it from the following sources, in this order:

1. The first .xcode-version file found by searching the current working directory and each of its parent directories until reaching the root of your filesystem. You can modify the .ruby-version file in the current working directory with the xcenv local command.

2. The global ~/.xcenv/.xcode-version file. You can modify this file using the xcenv global command. If the global version file is not present, xcenv assumes you want to use the "system" Xcodeâ€”i.e. whatever is returned by xcode-select -p

## Installation

### Basic Git Installation

To install xcenv:

	$ git clone git@github.com:xcenv/xcenv.git ~/.xcenv

Copy the following into your shell profile file:

	export PATH="$HOME/.xcenv/bin:$PATH"
	eval "$(xcenv init -)"
